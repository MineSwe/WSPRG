This is the final project for web server programming in high school.<br/>
It's a copy of X called M (very original I know) with a register, login, feed and follower function.<br/>
Right now it isn't connected to any webpage since it uses a database system and I'm too scared to create one using github.<br/>
To use the website download all the files, connect it to a database, copy the tables from my code and open index.html.
